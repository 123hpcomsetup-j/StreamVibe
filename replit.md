- **Solution**: Monorepo with shared folder for common code
- **Benefits**: Type safety across the stack, reduced duplication
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly more complex build process

#### Token-Based Economy
- **Problem**: Monetization and creator-viewer interaction
- **Solution**: Virtual token system with real money backing
- **Benefits**: Controlled economy, easy tip tracking, admin oversight
- **Trade-offs**: Requires payment integration and admin approval workflow

#### Role-Based Access Control
- **Problem**: Different user types need different permissions
- **Solution**: Enum-based roles with middleware protection
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, scalable permission system
- **Trade-offs**: More complex routing and UI logic

#### Replit Auth Integration
- **Problem**: User authentication and management
- **Solution**: Leverage Replit's OAuth system
- **Benefits**: Seamless integration, no custom auth needed
- **Trade-offs**: Platform dependency, limited customization

## Testing & User Management

### Test Account Setup
- Created dedicated test users for each role type
- Manual role switching via SQL for testing different flows
- Comprehensive testing documentation in TESTING.md
- Role switching guide in ROLE_SWITCHER.md

### Authentication Limitations
- OAuth shows "StreamConnect" name (Replit's registered app name)
- Cannot create traditional username/password accounts
- Testing requires manual database role updates
- Single OAuth identity used for role testing
