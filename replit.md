## Recent Changes (July 30, 2025)

**STREAM CHAT SYSTEM COMPLETED - Clean Interface Below Video (July 30, 2025):**
Successfully implemented clean chat interface in stream viewing experience per user request. Added chat system that fits screen below video component (80% video, 20% chat) with real-time messaging functionality. Chat includes message counter badge, role-based username styling (creators yellow, viewers blue, guests gray), auto-scroll to latest messages, and proper authentication checks. Authenticated users can send messages directly to streamers while non-authenticated users see login prompt. System integrates with existing chat API endpoints and WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates.

**TOKEN PURCHASE ADMIN PANEL ISSUE RESOLVED - System Working Correctly (July 30, 2025):**
Investigated and resolved token purchase visibility issue in admin panel. Root cause: all existing token purchases had already been approved, leaving no pending purchases to display. Token purchase system confirmed fully functional with comprehensive testing: customer purchase creation works correctly, admin API returns proper pending purchase data, database operations complete successfully, and authentication/authorization working as expected. Admin panel now displays pending purchases correctly when new purchases are submitted by customers.

**TIP AND ACTIVITY BROADCASTING ENHANCED - Creator Overlay Real-Time Notifications (July 30, 2025):**

- **Key Tables**: users, streams, transactions, token_purchases, reports, payouts, chat_messages, sessions

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Simple username/password authentication with bcrypt
- **Session Storage**: Express sessions with 7-day TTL
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (viewer, creator, admin)
- **User Management**: Registration form with role selection
- **Security**: Bcrypt password hashing, session-based authentication

### Streaming Platform
- **Live Streams**: Real-time streaming with viewer count tracking
- **Stream Categories**: Art & Design, Gaming, Music, etc.
- **Creator Dashboard**: Stream management, earnings tracking, settings
- **Admin Panel**: Content moderation, user management, system oversight

### Token Economy
- **Virtual Currency**: Token-based tipping system
- **Purchase Flow**: UPI-based token purchases with admin approval
- **Transactions**: Peer-to-peer token transfers between users
- **Earnings**: Creator earnings tracking and payout management

### Real-time Features
- **Chat System**: Live chat during streams with tip integration
- **Stream Status**: Real-time stream status updates
- **Notifications**: Toast-based user feedback system

## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
1. User accesses protected route
2. Middleware checks session validity
3. Redirects to Replit Auth if unauthenticated
4. OAuth callback creates/updates user record
5. Session established with role-based permissions

### Streaming Workflow
1. Creator starts stream from dashboard
2. Stream metadata stored in database
3. Live status updated for discovery
4. Viewers join stream and participate in chat
5. Tips processed through token system
6. Earnings tracked for creator payouts

### Token Transaction Flow
1. User initiates token purchase with UPI
2. Purchase request stored as pending
3. Admin reviews and approves/rejects
4. Tokens credited to user wallet
5. Users can tip creators during streams
6. Transactions recorded for audit trail

## External Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Dev Server**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Session Store**: PostgreSQL sessions table
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, REPLIT_DOMAINS

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Static assets built with Vite to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: Node.js server bundled with ESBuild
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit push command
- **Process Management**: Single Node.js process serving both API and static files

### Architecture Decisions

#### Monorepo Structure
- **Problem**: Shared types and utilities between frontend and backend
- **Solution**: Monorepo with shared folder for common code
- **Benefits**: Type safety across the stack, reduced duplication
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly more complex build process

#### Token-Based Economy
- **Problem**: Monetization and creator-viewer interaction
- **Solution**: Virtual token system with real money backing
- **Benefits**: Controlled economy, easy tip tracking, admin oversight
- **Trade-offs**: Requires payment integration and admin approval workflow

#### Role-Based Access Control
- **Problem**: Different user types need different permissions
- **Solution**: Enum-based roles with middleware protection
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, scalable permission system
- **Trade-offs**: More complex routing and UI logic

#### Replit Auth Integration
- **Problem**: User authentication and management
- **Solution**: Leverage Replit's OAuth system
- **Benefits**: Seamless integration, no custom auth needed
- **Trade-offs**: Platform dependency, limited customization

## Testing & User Management

### Test Account Setup
- Created dedicated test users for each role type
- Manual role switching via SQL for testing different flows
- Comprehensive testing documentation in TESTING.md
- Role switching guide in ROLE_SWITCHER.md
