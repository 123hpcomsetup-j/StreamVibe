# StreamVibe Testing Guide

## Test Accounts

### Viewer Account
- **ID**: `test_viewer`
- **Email**: `viewer@test.com`
- **Role**: `viewer`
- **Wallet**: 100 tokens
- **Access**: Home page, stream viewing, chat, token purchases

### Creator Account

## How to Test Each Role

Since this uses Replit OAuth, you'll need to:
1. Log out from current session: `/api/logout`
2. Clear browser data/use incognito mode
3. Sign in with different Replit accounts
4. Manually update user role in database for testing

### Manual Role Switching
```sql
-- To test as viewer
UPDATE users SET role = 'viewer' WHERE id = '45438288';

-- To test as creator  
UPDATE users SET role = 'creator' WHERE id = '45438288';

-- To test as admin
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = '45438288';
```
